# Hello GitHub Actions

_Create and run a GitHub Actions workflow._

</header>

## Purpose of the Repository

This repository demonstrates the use of GitHub Actions to automate various aspects of a software development workflow. The workflows in this repository handle tasks such as building the project, debugging, fixing issues, managing dependencies, and more.

## Instructions on How to Use the Workflows

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. **Navigate to the repository**: Change to the repository directory using `cd heloai-hello-github-actions`.
3. **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch for your changes using `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
4. **Make changes**: Make the necessary changes to your code or workflow files.
5. **Commit changes**: Commit your changes using `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.
6. **Push changes**: Push your changes to the remote repository using `git push origin <branch-name>`.
7. **Create a pull request**: Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.
8. **Monitor workflows**: Monitor the workflows in the Actions tab of your repository to ensure they run successfully.

## List of Workflows and Their Descriptions

1. **.github/workflows/0-welcome.yml**: Handles repository setup and posts a welcome message.
2. **.github/workflows/1-create-a-workflow.yml**: Handles creating a workflow file.
3. **.github/workflows/2-add-a-job.yml**: Handles adding a job to the workflow.
4. **.github/workflows/3-add-actions.yml**: Handles adding steps to the workflow.
5. **.github/workflows/4-merge-your-pull-request.yml**: Handles merging pull requests.
6. **.github/workflows/5-trigger.yml**: Handles triggering workflows.
7. **.github/workflows/build.yml**: Handles building the project and managing dependencies.
8. **.github/workflows/debug.yml**: Handles debugging and fixing issues.
9. **.github/workflows/codeql.yml**: Handles security analysis.
10. **.github/workflows/quantum-computing.yml**: Handles quantum computing tasks, including setting up the environment and running quantum algorithms and simulations.
11. **.github/workflows/web3-build.yml**: Handles building and deploying web 3 projects, including setting up the environment and installing necessary libraries.
12. **.github/workflows/security-enhancements.yml**: Handles advanced security tasks, including setting up the environment, running security scans, penetration tests, and vulnerability assessments.
13. **.github/workflows/finance-bots.yml**: Handles the creation and management of finance bots, including setting up environments for crypto bots, forex bots, and sports betting bots.

## Instructions on How to Trigger the Workflows Manually

1. **Navigate to the Actions tab**: Go to the Actions tab of your repository on GitHub.
2. **Select the workflow**: Choose the workflow you want to trigger from the list of workflows.
3. **Click on the "Run workflow" button**: Click the "Run workflow" button to manually trigger the workflow.
4. **Monitor the workflow**: Monitor the workflow run in the Actions tab to ensure it completes successfully.

## Step 5: Trigger the workflow

_You've now added a fully functioning workflow to your repository! :smile:_

The shell script in the workflow will run whenever a new pull request is opened.

**Seeing your _action_ in action**: The status of each workflow run that's triggered is shown in the pull request before it's merged: look for **All checks have passed** when you try out the steps below. You can also see a list of all the workflows that are running, or have finished running, in the **Actions** tab of your repository. From there, you can click on each workflow run to view more details and access log files.

### :keyboard: Activity: Trigger the workflow

1. Make a new branch named `test-workflow`.
1. Make a change, such as adding an emoji to your README.md file, and commit the change directly to your new branch.
1. In the **Pull requests** tab, create a pull request that will merge `test-workflow` into `main`.
1. Watch the workflow running in the checks section of the pull request.
1. Notice the comment that the workflow adds to the pull request.
1. Wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). Another workflow will run and will replace the contents of this README file with instructions for the next step.
